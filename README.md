## Description

This project analyzes accident data in India to identify patterns, trends, and factors contributing to accidents. It utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization.

<!-- TODO: Add more details about the project's goals and objectives -->

## Features

*   Data analysis of accident datasets.
*   Visualization of accident trends and patterns.
*   Jupyter Notebook-based analysis.

<!-- TODO: Elaborate on specific features and insights gained from the analysis -->

## Tech Stack

*   Jupyter Notebook
*   Python

<!-- TODO: List specific Python libraries used, such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. -->
